# Quest of Zelda - An NFT Based Game

![Quest Of Zelda](/images/logo.png)

Quest of Zelda is a unique form of NFT based game that breaks the shackles of forced cut-scenes for story progression and instead allows the players to decide how the story will progress. The players are able to interact with smart NPCs in the game. Each NPC has a unique story of their own and based on the question asked they provide the corresponding information as a response. Thus the players get to ask unique questions based on their quest and the responses help shape their gameplay. The player are able to acquire information that they can then write down in their diary that forms an integral part of the NFT adding value to the character as the player puts in more effort. Developers are also welcomed to develop their own side stories and characters that players can also play.
Try running some of the following tasks:

## Game Story

The curse of the Green Sage is real. Legend has it that when a prosporous kingdom Zelda was destroyed by the evil conquerers, the Green Sage exercised the great curse upon the people of the land that turned them into monster. Their only way of salvation was to find the Orb of Truth, that was lost to mankind with time. While people slowly accepted these monsters, they still remain outcasted from most human activities. Their only objective from birth is to find the lost Kingdom of Zelda and retrun back to human form. People hope they find their way back to humanity one day.

## Background

NFT based games are the latest craze in the market that are generating millions of dollars in revenue. I have tried to utilize some new technologies to implement NFT character based games that is very different from traditional story based games that follow a certain pattern. The idea here is that the players will now interact with NPCs in the game to gain informations and try to progress based on this. Each NPC will have a background story of their own based on which they will answer any question that the player throws at them. Relevant questions will result in useful information as response from the NPC that will act as clues or objectives to progress through the game.
