# Quest of Zelda - An NFT Based Game

Quest of Zelda is a unique form of NFT based game that breaks the shackles of forced cut-scenes for story progression and instead allows the players to decide how the story will progress. The players are able to interact with smart NPCs in the game. Each NPC has a unique story of their own and based on the question asked they provide the corresponding information as a response. Thus the players get to ask unique questions based on their quest and the responses help shape their gameplay. The player are able to acquire information that they can then write down in their diary that forms an integral part of the NFT adding value to the character as the player puts in more effort. Developers are also welcomed to develop their own side stories and characters that players can also play.
